# üéâ Summary of Implemented Improvements

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dynamic Title for Affiliate Sites** 
**Problem**: Title was hardcoded as "2T DATA" regardless of site
**Solution**: 
- Updated `SiteContext.jsx` to dynamically set `document.title` based on current site name
- Main site shows: "2TDATA - Master Platform"
- Affiliate sites show their respective names: "TechHub Affiliate", "FinanceFlow Affiliate", etc.

### 2. **Site-Specific Logo Display**
**Problem**: Header always showed the same logo
**Solution**:
- Updated `Header.jsx` to use `currentSite.logo_url` or `currentSite.theme_config.logoUrl`
- Added fallback to default image if site logo fails to load
- Added proper error handling for missing logos

### 3. **Logo Upload Functionality for Super Admin**
**Problem**: Super admin couldn't upload logos properly
**Solution**:
- Added `multer` package for file upload handling
- Created `upload.js` middleware for logo upload with proper validation
- Updated site controller to handle multipart/form-data
- Added static file serving for uploaded images
- Added automatic cleanup of old logo files

### 4. **Domain Management in Admin Panel**
**Problem**: Admin form should show all domains for editing
**Solution**:
- `SiteForm.jsx` already supports multiple domains with add/remove functionality
- Displays all domains with primary domain marked
- Allows adding new domains and removing existing ones
- Shows proper validation and conflict detection

### 5. **Forbidden Header Error Fix**
**Problem**: Frontend was getting "Attempt to set a forbidden header was denied: Host"
**Solution**:
- Fixed `fetch()` call in `MyService.jsx` with proper CORS configuration
- Cleaned up axios configuration to avoid manual header manipulation
- Let browser handle Host headers naturally
